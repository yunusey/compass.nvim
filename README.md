# Setup 📦
You can setup using different package managers.

## Packer
```lua
-- In init.lua
use 'yunusey/compass.nvim'
require('compass').setup({
  	-- your config here
})
```

## Lazy 💤
```lua
-- In lua/plugins/compass.lua
local spec = {
  	"yunusey/compass.nvim",
  	configure = function ()
    	require('compass').setup({
      		-- your config here
    	})
  	end
}
return spec 
```

PS: There are also other package managers that you can use...

# Configuration ⚙️
`compass.nvim` comes with several default options:
```lua
M.def_opts = { -- Default options
	highlight = { fg = "#00ff00" },
	hlname = "CompassHintWindow",
	precedence = { -- Sets the precedence for letters to be used
		'j', 'k', 'h',
		'l', 'a', 's',
		'd', 'f', 'g',
		'w', 'e', 'r',
		't', 'y', 'u',
		'i', 'o', 'c',
		'v', 'b', 'n',
	},
	window = { -- Gets the same arguments as |nvim_open_win|
		width  = 2,
		height = 1,
		border = "rounded",
		style  = "minimal",
	},
	keymaps = {
		i = "<leader>cw",
		n = "<leader>cw",
		v = "<leader>cw",
	}
}

```
You can change the color and the style of the highlight. Takes the same arguments with ```|vim.api.nvim_set_hl|```. You can also change the highlight-name by changing ```hlname```. 

You can set your ```precedence```. While creating hints, compass iterates through all the ```precedence``` table. Say you have three windows open, and your precedence table is the following:
```lua
precedence = {"j", "k", "l", "h", --[[other strs...]]}
```

`compass.nvim` assigns the first element (`j`) to the first window. Second element (`k`) to the second window. Third element (`l`) to the last window. Since all the windows have their own element assigned, iteration will end...

You can change the width and the height of the hint-windows. Also, you can change the border & style. For more info, see ```|vim.api.nvim_open_win|```

`compass.nvim` comes with some default keymaps. You can either override, or delete them.

## For deleting keymaps:

```lua
local compass = require('compass')
compass.setup({
	-- Your other configs
	keymaps = {}, -- Assign it to an empty table
	-- Your other configs
})
```

## For overriding keymaps:

```lua
local compass = require('compass')
compass.setup({
	-- Your other configs
	keymaps = {
		n = "<C-w",
		-- From now on, whenever you type 'Control-W' in normal mode, compass will be executed...
		i = ",w",
		-- From now on, whenever you type ',w' in insert mode, compass will be executed
		v = "<leader>ww",
		-- From now on, whenever you type '<leader>ww' in visual mode, compass will be executed
	}, -- Assign it to an empty table
	-- Your other configs
})
```

PS: You do not necessarily need to fill for every mode. When you do not put a mode as a key, it'll not set a keymap for that mode.
